## Preprocessing 
Download the data files and run the read_file.py in the same folder. Make a directory called files. The final_prod.csv will be generated along with testing_data.csv. 
## Machine Learning Model
Run the aml_patient.m mentioning the lambda value and the kfold value. Best values k-fold=5 and lambda=0.01. The files are present in the model folder. This will generate Pred.csv file. 
## Post Processing
Later run the file_processing.csv to generate the final files in the files folder.
